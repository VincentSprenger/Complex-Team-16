The final code is called is the phase1.75.py code. This can be run in its entirety as it has a menu implemented. Run and choose which test you want to be performed. Be advised certain tests have run alot of different values for multiple runs which can lead to 30 min+ wait times. 

In terms of version control due to inexperience with git, multiple versions where uploaded (otherwise we would have worked solely in phase1.py), this may lead to people being underrepresented in the ammount of code written when checking commits on the final version (1.75).

Test_wiener.py was used to test the noise generation and create graphs for such.

If you want to test the code with different parameters they can be changed in the initialization of the simulation; 

- roomsize
- desired velocity
- noise strength
- n_individuals
- radius
- std_radius
- panic parameter
- doors
- known exits
