# Complex-Team-16

The final code is called in the phase1.75.py code. This can be run in its entirety as it has a menu implemented. Run and choose which test you want to be performed. Be advised certain tests have run alot of different values for multiple runs which can lead to 30 min+ wait times. 

In terms of version control due to inexperience with git, multiple versions where uploaded (otherwise we would have worked solely in phase1.py), this may lead to people being underrepresented in the amount of code written when checking commits on the final version (1.75).

Phase1.75.py contains the full project code.
Test_wiener.py was used to test the noise generation and create graphs for such.
GranularDyamics.py contains an animation testing the Brazil Nut effect and segregation in the system.
baseline social force model.ipynb contains a very early implementation of the social force model.

If you want to test the code with different parameters they can be changed in the initialization of the simulation; 

- roomsize
- desired velocity
- noise strength
- n_individuals
- radius
- std_radius
- panic parameter
- doors
- known exits

The presentation slides can be also found in the git under Slides_ Complexity and Emergence in Granular Crowd Dynamics.pdf
